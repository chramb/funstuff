		Netavark is a rust based network stack for containers. It is being designed 
		to work with <pkg>app-containers/podman</pkg> but is also applicable for other OCI container management applications.
		This plugin sets up the use of dnsmasq on a given CNI network so that Pods 
		can resolve each other by name. When configured, the pod and its IP address 
		are added to a network specific hosts file that dnsmasq reads in. Similarly, 
		when a pod is removed from the network, it will remove the entry from the hosts file.
		Each CNI network will have its own dnsmasq instance.

		The dnsname plugin was specifically designed for the <pkg>app-containers/podman</pkg> container engine.
